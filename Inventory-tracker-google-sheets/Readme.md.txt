# Google Sheets Inventory Tracker

This is a simple inventory tracking system built with Google Sheets. It helps record incoming and outgoing items along with usage purposes, and shows a summary of item movements using pivot tables and formulas.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Logs item name, quantity, entry date, exit date, and purpose
- Pivot table showing total in/out and current stock per item
- Conditional formulas like SUMIF to calculate totals
- TODAY() function for automatic date tracking
- Data validation for cleaner, more reliable inputs
- Filterable log for quick review

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- Users input each stock movement (in/out) through a simple form table
- Pivot table auto-updates to show summarized stock data
- Formulas handle totals and remaining stock calculation
